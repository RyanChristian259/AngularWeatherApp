# Angular Weather App
This is a weather widget that showcases HTTP calls with Angular 6.

### In order for the HTTP calls to work you must sign up for the Mapquest api and the dark sky api.

Mapquest api - https://developer.mapquest.com

Dark sky api - https://darksky.net/dev

Once you have your API keys from the above sites simply place them in the sample.contants.ts file where applicable. I have listed the locations as "Your key here". Then rename the file to `constants.ts`.

### Don't forget to add `constants.*` to your .gitignore file so that you don't push your api keys up to github.
